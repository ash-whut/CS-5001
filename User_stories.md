As an algorithm developer, I want to implement an automated process that can perform architecture search for the purposes of modulation classification to accelerate the discovery of robust models for wireless communication systems

As an algorithm developer, I want to use reinforcement learning to explore novel model topologies so that I don't have to manually build and test configurations through trial and error

As an algorithm developer, I want to leverage I/Q signal data provided by RadioML to identify the most effective model for classifying modulation types
