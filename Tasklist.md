# Ashwin Menon - Tasks

- Analyze background research paper for MetaQNN by Bowen Baker
- Research and find existing implementations of reinforcement learning to find small neural networks
- Procure dataset for radio signals (2021 RadioML)
- Analyze dataset to understand and unpack it
- Create baseline neural network model (and train it) for comparison with our final candidate models
- Smoke test RL implementation to see if replay database and Q-table are being initialized properly along with saved models
- Run small scale experiments (create around 100-200 models) each if necessary to fine-tune reward function
- Create scoring function to rank candidate models so that we can pick top-k models from the replay database
- Develop analysis methods to analyze the performance of candidate models
- Perform cleaning up and reorganization of code if necessary. Additionally, create pipelines for reproducibility
